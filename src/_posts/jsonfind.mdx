I'm working with some fairly large (>100MB) JSON files for a project right now. Due to the large file sizes, it's a little frustrating using VS Code or similar editors to navigate the contents. A lot of editors become slow shortly after opening these files.

So I wrote a little utility called `jf`, short for "JSON Find." Given a value to search for and a filepath, it will search for the value and print out a dotted path for each occurrence found. Paths output are compatible with `jq`.

Here it is in action!

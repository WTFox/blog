It almost looks like a regular variable, but you add parentheses to it. And items are separated by spaces (or newlines), not commas.

```sh
movies=(
	"The Holy Grail"
	"The Life of Brian"
	"The Meaning of Life"
)
```

<br />
<br />


Ever wondered how you print an array in bash? It's not like this, this only prints the first element.

```sh
echo $movies 
```

<br />
<br />


You use the @ symbol to print all the elements.

```sh
echo ${movies[@]} # the "@" sign refers to all the elements.
```

<br />
<br />


Ever wondered how you print the length of an array in bash? The `#` symbol is used to print the length of an array. So you would think that this would print the length of the array:

```sh
echo ${#movies}    # this prints the length of the first element.
echo ${#movies[0]} # does the same thing here.
```


<br />
<br />


Nope. This prints the length of the array.

```sh
echo ${#movies[@]} # because the "@" references all the elements.
```


<br />
<br />


Ever wondered how you get a random element?

```sh
echo ${movies[$RANDOM % ${#movies[@]}]}
```


<br />
<br />


`RANDOM` is a special variable that returns a random integer between 0 and 32767. The modulo operator (`%`) is used to get a random number between 0 and the length of the array.

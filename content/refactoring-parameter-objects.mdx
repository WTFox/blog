There are times when I'm building out a constructor or function and I find that I've ended up with a large number of parameters. Technically, there's nothing wrong with a lot of parameters. Your code will likely still work fine. But readability is sacrificed. And it's likely that some coupling is happening, too. I keep an eye out for this smell because it sometimes means I can replace some of these parameters with a parameter object.

Let's take an ssh connection for example. You might have some code that looks like this:

<CodeBlock
  language={"go"}
  code={`
func NewClient(protocol, host, user, pass, port, path string) *ssh.Client {
    // stuff...
    return client
}
`}
/>

This code is fine and would absolutely work but it could be better with a parameter object.

<CodeBlock
  language={"go"}
  code={`
// Params is a parameter object
type Params struct {
    protocol,
    host,
    user,
    pass,
    port,
    path string
}

func NewClient(params Params) \*ssh.Client {
    // stuff...
    return client
}
`}
/>

This is a pretty easy process and the value added isn't only in the shorter parameter list. The new `Params` type could also enable an abstraction of existing code that increases maintainability and readability.

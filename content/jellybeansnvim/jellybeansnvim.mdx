I wrote a neovim theme called Jellybeans.nvim. It's a port of the popular Jellybeans theme for Neovim. It's a dark theme with a lot of colors. It's a bit different from the original Jellybeans theme, but I think it captures the spirit of the original. It also includes a light variant and support for many popular plugins.

Why did I do this? There's no reason I can come up with that isn't highly subjective. I wanted something that I couldn't find in the existing themes. I wanted something that was colorful but not too bright. I wanted something that was easy on the eyes but not boring. I wanted something that was different but not too different. I wanted something that was just right.

If you want a theme that isn't _too colorful_ but still colorful, or a theme that isn't _too blue_, I encourage you to try it out.

It's available on [GitHub](https://github.com/WTFox/jellybeans.nvim). Pull requests and issues are welcome!

A **fault** is defined as a component of a system deviating from its spec. A **failure** is when the system as a whole stops providing the required service to the user. Systems that can anticipate faults and cope with them are **fault-tolerant** or **resilient**. Obviously, we can't anticipate every type of fault so it only makes sense to talk about certain types.

## Hardware

- Hard disks have a mean time to failure (`MTTF`) of about 10 to 50 years
- Redundancy and dual power supplies help
- So does moving away from single-server systems

## Software

- Software bugs
- Runaway processes
- Third-Party API failures

Carefully thinking about assumption and interactions made in the software can help

## Humans

- Understand that _all_ humans are unreliable
- Design systems that minimizes opportunity for error.
- Decouple the places where people make the most mistakes from the places that cause system failures
- Test thoroughly at all levels
- Set up monitoring/logs

Some tools exist to try and trigger faults as a way to see where the weak points in the application are.

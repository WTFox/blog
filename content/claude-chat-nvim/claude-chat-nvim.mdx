I've been using Claude Code CLI pretty heavily lately, and while it's fantastic, I found myself constantly switching between my editor and terminal to share context with Claude. So I built a little Neovim plugin that bridges that gap.

[claude-chat.nvim](https://github.com/wtfox/claude-chat.nvim) wraps the Claude Code CLI and automatically shares your current file context, selections, and custom prompts. Hit `<leader>cc`, type your question, and Claude gets your file path and any selected code without you having to manually copy-paste anything. It opens Claude in a split window right inside Neovim, so you can chat while keeping your code visible. The plugin is smart about context tooâ€”if you have text selected, it sends that along with your prompt; if not, it just sends the current file context.

It's nothing revolutionary, just a simple wrapper that makes the Claude Code experience a bit smoother when you're deep in a coding session. Built mostly with Claude itself, which felt appropriately meta. Pull requests welcome if you want to help make it better!

I have a go app that runs via scheduled task on my Synology NAS DS218+. Compiling GO binaries for major platforms is fairly straight forward. Compiling GO binaries for Synology is a bit more involved. The following is what I've found to work.

First, install musl-cross.

```sh
$ brew install FiloSottile/musl-cross/musl-cross
```

Then run the following `go build` command.

```sh
$ CC=x86_64-linux-musl-gcc \\
  CXX=x86_64-linux-musl-g++ \\
  GOARCH=amd64 \\
  GOOS=linux \\
  CGO_ENABLED=1 \\
  go build -ldflags "-linkmode external -extldflags -static"
```

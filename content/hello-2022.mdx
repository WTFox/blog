# What's new?

## afox.dev

The blog has been updated from Gatsby version 2 to 4! It builds without any warnings or errors in the console, and I'm pretty proud of that. I've spent more time working on this site than writing actual content.

I own two domains for this blog: anthonyfox.io and afox.dev. The .io address was the default, but afox.dev will become the default URL since it's shorter.

## Mermaid support

I can now embed mermaid diagrams directly in my posts! I don't make new years resolutions, but if I did, getting better at diagramming relationships, flows, etc., would be one of them! [MermaidJS](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) is a tool I've been using at work lately. You write your "diagrams" in markdown fences, and Mermaid will render it into diagrams! Plain text domination!!

Here's an example, I can write the following directly into markdown files.

```text
erDiagram
    CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places
    ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains
    CUSTOMER }|..|{ DELIVERY-ADDRESS : uses

    CUSTOMER {
        string firstName
        string lastName
    }
```

...and it magically renders to this!

<Mermaid
  definition={`\
erDiagram
    CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places
    ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains
    CUSTOMER }|..|{ DELIVERY-ADDRESS : uses
    CUSTOMER {
        string firstName
        string lastName
    }
`}
/>

## Books

Here are some books I've read recently:

- Architecture Patterns with Python
  - Co-authored by Harry Percival (obey the testing goat!), the book goes into topics like Domain-Driven Design, Coupling vs. Cohesion, and Abstractions with microservices.
- How to Win Friends and Influence People in the Digital Age
  - This is the original, but with additional examples on how to apply the same concepts in today's world.
- Hail Mary
  - I'm halfway through this book and, so far, I'm enjoying it more than The Martian.
